## About The Project

IPL Match Predictor is a Flask Application that deploys a Machine Learning Model that can predict the winner of an IPL Match. The Algorithm
used to develop and deploy the Machine Learning Application was Random Forest and has been developed to research intuitive work on utilizing Machine Learning in Sports and Academics. The project was displayed during Project Expo held on February 1, 2020 at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology.
